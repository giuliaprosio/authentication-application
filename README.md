# Authentication Application
This repository contains the **backend** and **frontend**
folders for my authentication application. 
Each component is a standalone server with detailed
documentation on how to set up and run it.

Together, they form a two-tier 
architecture for user registration and authentication.

## Technologies Used
* **Backend**: Built with Spring Boot 3, with Spring Security 6 and JPA 
for secure user registration and authentication. Users are stored in a 
MySQL database, and authorization is managed with OAuth2 and JWT.
* **DB**: MySQL
* **Frontend**: Developed with React as framework and Vite for efficient 
bundling and performance
